# StarExplorer
To use this app first open the Corona simulator. The app has a ship in the center. With this ship you can drag side to side and backward and forward with the mouse. When you click with the mouse the ship will shoot a red beam to hit asteroids. When an asteroid is hit the player will receive 100 points. The lives and points of the player is at the top of the screen. The player has three lives. Used lua.
